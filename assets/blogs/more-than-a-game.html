        <h5 class="blog-title">IT'S MORE THAN A GAME</h5>
        <br />
        <p class="blog-text">
          If a religion is a set of beliefs and rules that a person devotes
          themselves to because they believe in a greater importance, then the
          raw passion that I witnessed on February 8, 2018, made it obvious to
          me that a religious-like devotion can come in many different shapes
          and forms. Whenever I close my eyes, I can still remember the
          excitement like it was yesterday. It was the day that the school for
          which I attend, the University of North Carolina, was destined to
          collide in a men’s basketball game with the loathed Blue Devils of
          Duke University. However, make no mistake about it, the anticipation
          and preparation for this single event had been building for weeks in
          advance, and on the day of the game it seemed like the air itself
          within Chapel Hill could explode at any given moment with the
          abundance of excitement and anxiousness. You could see it on the faces
          of the people, on the decorations on the buildings, and even in the
          sounds of the city. Although the calendar only read the date of
          February 8, it was obvious that this was no ordinary day in the hearts
          of the people within these communities. <br /><br />For some families
          in North Carolina, the college basketball rivalry that occurs on
          “Tobacco Road” between the state’s most
          <img class="blog-image" src="../images/dean-dome.jpg" /> prominent
          colleges run deeper than blood itself. While it may be just a series
          of rudimentary games, these in-state clashes have the potential to
          divide happy families in half, the power to pull an individual through
          their monotonous 9-5 job each and every day, and the ability to give a
          broken person the chance to momentarily forget about their sorrows as
          they participate in the roller coaster of emotions that exist within
          the game. To the winner goes the spoils, and to the loser goes weeks
          of embarrassment as they are inevitably forced to intermingle with
          fans of the winning team. <br /><br />For this version of the self-proclaimed
          “greatest rivalry in sports”, the town of Chapel Hill served as host
          for the game that would command the nation’s attention. Located near
          the center of North Carolina and in close proximity to the other large
          cities within the state, Chapel Hill is the ideal college town and
          absolutely thrives off of the energy that flows from the college
          campus. It is as if the town comes alive for this game, and the local
          businesses and restaurants do the same. For me personally, I grew up
          counting down the days to the annual Carolina-Duke game as a child and
          dreamed of one day being able to participate in the spectacle for
          myself. This game in February was my first taste of the rivalry as an
          actual student at Chapel Hill, and I vividly remember how the entire
          atmosphere around seemed surreal, as if the normal world couldn’t
          possibly contain this much passion. I watched the game in an
          auditorium filled to the brim with other UNC students, and every point
          scored was cheered as if the lottery was just won. When the game had
          ended and Carolina had emerged victorious, every single student on
          campus proceeded to rush Franklin street in a full out sprint. Looking
          back, I can still feel the cold air sting my lungs as I pushed myself
          to run faster than I ever have. For someone who grew up watching the
          unfolding events through the monitor of a TV screen, the feeling of
          actually being felt more powerful than even words can describe. It may
          just be a simple game, but it means so much more.
