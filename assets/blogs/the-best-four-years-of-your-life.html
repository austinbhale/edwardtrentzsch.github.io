        <h5 class="blog-title">"THE BEST FOUR YEARS OF YOUR LIFE"</h5>
        <br />
        <p class="blog-text">
          There are certain months that have a greater meaning than others
          because of some special event that happens during the month. December
          is treasured because it serves as the home to Christmas, July is
          famous for the Fourth of July, and the month of April is heavily
          anticipated because of the celebration of Easter. However, in the
          minds of most anxious seniors in high school, there are only two
          months in the universe that hold any meaning at all: November and
          January. These are the months that
          <img class="blog-image" src="../images/graduation.jpg" /> the Common
          Application, an extremely popular online college application, closes
          as thousands of aspiring scholars desperately try to put the finishing
          touches on their application. While it may seem like an exaggeration,
          the large financial obligations and life-altering potential make the
          business of college a monumental staple of our society, and the
          college application process truly serves as a gateway to the future
          for the applicant. <br /><br />Take it from someone who has vividly
          experienced it firsthand, the process of applying to and accepting a
          college can be stressful. The application process, in particular, can
          be tedious and downright confusing, and by the time that I had
          finished all of my applications I felt that I had discovered useless
          personal information that I didn’t even know existed. The essay
          prompts are generally vague to the point of obscurity as applicants
          nervously try to portray the image of the student that they believe
          the university wants to see. Keep in mind that all this preparation is
          happening while on a strict deadline that is set in stone like the ten
          commandments. Once all the work is finally done and the applications
          are submitted (after paying a pricey application fee of course), then
          the waiting game begins as the suspense of approval or rejection sets
          in. Similar to the feeling of suffocation, the feeling of anxiousness
          grows as more time passes and the period for acceptance/rejection
          letters grows nearer. The entire process can be exhausting and takes a
          young adult on a roller coaster of emotions that can completely shape
          the outlook of their life. <br /><br />However, if the situation is
          right and the stars perfectly align, the thrill of college can make
          the arduous application process and stress of waiting seem trivial and
          worth the wait. For me personally, college has opened so many doors
          both socially and academically that I will treasure for the rest of my
          life, and the memories I have made here so far are priceless. Above
          everything else, whether it be when applying to college or during
          move-in day, the most important thing for someone involved in the
          college system to remember is to just be yourself. While this may
          sound simple and generic, a college essay will sound much more
          compelling if it is coming from the emotions of someone who believes
          what they are writing, and people naturally gravitate to individuals
          who are genuine. College, like anything in life, has the possibility
          to be a special four years that can be treasured forever. So to anyone
          who is about on a new journey, I would advise you to enjoy the process
          and don’t spend these moments being a fake to others and a fake to
          yourself.
