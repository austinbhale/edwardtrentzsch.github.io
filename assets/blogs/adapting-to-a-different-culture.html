        <h5 class="blog-title">ADAPTING TO A DIFFERENT CULTURE</h5>
        <p class="blog-text">
          My mother lived a pretty straightforward life back in her home country
          of Panama. Originally born in the rural Panamanian countryside, my
          mother and her family migrated to the metropolis of Panama City when
          she was a young girl for the greater economic benefits that the city
          provides. From that point on, my mom would embark on the journey of
          trying to further her educational opportunities as a young women in
          the big city while also helping to provide for her family. However,
          everything in my mother’s life changed when she met an ambitious
          American soldier who convinced her to trade the life she lived in
          Panama for another in a foreign land completely different from her
          own. Fast forward over twenty years to the present, and my mother is
          the poster child for the ideal American citizen and fully immersed
          herself in this country’s different culture. But the transition for
          her was anything but easy, and this struggle of adaption is a problem
          experienced by someone new every minute. Trying to adapt to a
          different culture and a different way of life may seem like a simple
          issue from the outside looking in, but in reality words really cannot
          describe how difficult the transition can be for someone who has only
          known one way of life. Whether it be the food, the language, the
          physical environment, or even the societal values, these cultural
          differences can easily shock someone into despair as they try
          desperately try to make sense of the new universe that they now find
          themselves in. At my old high school back in Fayetteville, we had a
          foreign exchange program in place that provided the school with
          students originally from South Korea who had minimal experience with
          the American culture. Without questions, one of the greatest sources
          of pride from those affiliated with the school is the remarkable
          development of these exchange students, whose personas gradually
          change from lost and confused to confident and successful. This
          process is certainly not the same with everybody, but there are few
          feeling better than witnessing someone who has come from so far
          finally reach their goals. As of the time of writing, my mother is
          currently working as a English Second Language teacher throughout the
          Cumberland County school system. On a daily basis, my mom works with
          young children from different backgrounds to try to overcome some of
          the same cultural issues that she herself once battled with. Some
          children succeed more than others, but either way the results are
          often tangible improvements in at least the child’s willingness to
          explore the new way of life that they are surrounded in. We all have
          values and beliefs that make up who we are, and oftentimes these
          values are intertwined in the environment in which they were formed.
          Once that environment changes, it can be hard to hold on to the core
          of who we are while also trying to adjust ourselves to the values of a
          new environment. The next time you see someone who is going through a
          period of adjustment, keep in mind the personal struggle that they are
          going through and try to turn their attention to the bright
          possibilities of the future.My mother lived a pretty straightforward
