          SILENT SAM MATTERS. BUT ITS LOCATION DOES NOT
        </h5>
        <br />
        <p class="blog-text">
          As part of a message sent to the Chapel Hill community on Friday,
          August 31, under-fire school Chancellor Carol L. Folt issued a
          statement attempting to explain the increasingly toxic situation of
          the Silent Sam memorial. For those who are unfamiliar with the
          conflict that is currently consuming the picturesque college town of
          Chapel Hill, Silent Sam was a bronze statue erected on the campus at
          Chapel Hill depicting a Confederate soldier. During recent years, the
          racial and social tensions surrounding the statue have exploded as the
          true symbolism of the statue has been hotly contested by proponents
          from each side of the debate. These tensions reached their climax on
          Monday, August 21, when protesters at a rally toppled the statue and
          completely severed the connection between the statue and the pedestal
          upon which it stood. However, although the physical aspect of the
          statue may have been forcibly removed
          <img
            class="blog-image"
            src="../images/Silent-Sam-pedestal-from-side.jpg"
          />
          from the grounds of the university, the specter of the statue still
          looms around Chapel Hill as the debate over what to do now with the
          statue rapidly escalates. <br /><br />Fast forward to the present, and
          the university finds itself in the middle of a monumental crossroads
          that will go a long way in dictating the public perception of the
          university as an institution. On one hand, supporters who favor the
          removal of the statue assert that the presence of Silent Sam only
          serves as a continuous reminder for the racism that has plagued our
          region throughout history and threatens to still unravel our community
          in the present. Rather than try to protect and improve the quality of
          life for the students at the university, opposition to the statue
          highlights the tremendous amount of money and resources used to
          protect a useless chunk of rock as opposed to a living student.
          However, on the flip side. supporters of the statue draw attention to
          the profound history of the statue and point out how the monument of
          Silent Sam is literally intertwined the history and fabric of the
          university. Rather than symbolize hatred and racism, some supporters
          of the statue highlight the heritage the statue provides and how this
          link to the past can allow us to correct the mistakes made for the
          future. <br /><br />Near the bottom of the statement that Chancellor
          Folt sent out on Friday, the chancellor unveiled some crucial pieces
          of information regarding the future of the statue that could have
          major ramifications for the Orange County area. When discussing the
          topic of whether or not the statue will be re-erected, Chancellor Folt
          wrote that “Silent Sam has a place in our history and on our campus
          where its history can be taught, but not at the front door of a public
          research university”. This statement seems to suggest that the
          intended plan for the statue is to move it from its former location at
          McCorkle Place near Franklin Street to a different location on campus
          that is less visible and more remote. Before this conversation
          continues any farther, it should be acknowledged that Chancellor Folt
          is truly in a no-win scenario that forces her to make difficult
          decisions that will inevitably anger certain groups. Considering how
          heavily charged the atmosphere is both in Chapel Hill and in the
          nation in general, whatever decision that the Chancellor settles on
          will be met with equal amounts of criticism and praise.
          <br /><br />However, the rumored decision of reinstalling the statue
          on a different part of campus makes little sense and would be blind
          towards the reasons why people feel so emotionally invested in the
          statue in the first place. Whether the statue is located on the front
          door of campus or in the middle of a dumpster behind the dining hall,
          people will still flock to the statue because it embodies certain
          beliefs and values that some people are willing to sacrifice
          everything for if it means that these values will either be conserved
          or eradicated. Protesters and violence will still follow the statue,
          regardless of whether or not it is moved. Rather than make a decisive
          decision that would at least bring an end to the situation, it appears
          that the administration at the university is simply starting the same
          cycle to repeat all over again.
