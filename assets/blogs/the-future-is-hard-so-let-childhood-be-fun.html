        <h5 class="blog-title">THE FUTURE IS HARD. SO LET CHILDHOOD BE FUN</h5>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Within the fibers of American culture, there lies certain customs and
          institutions that build up to form the world-renowned American DNA
          that is known around the world. Think about things like fireworks on
          the Fourth of July, or a greasy cheeseburger sizzling on the grill, or
          even a case of ice cold beer rapidly being consumed by a group of
          excited fans at a football tailgate. However, as much as all of these
          glorious factors are all part of the traditional identity of the
          United States, there is also one less appealing factor that continues
          to be prevalent within our communities: parents who don’t understand
          the line between competitive and obsessive when it comes to youth
          sports. Although parents are supposed to be the role models for
          self-control and thoughtful behavior. all too often it is the adults
          who find themselves drunk by the hyper competitive fires of youth
          sports. A child enjoying the simple game of soccer My little brother,
          who is fourteen, plays for a travel soccer team in Fayetteville that
          is very compete and subsequently travels all throughout the state for
          various games and tournaments to showcase the talent and dedication of
          the children playing. A couple of years ago, my brother’s team
          participated in a relatively elite tournament in Mooresville, a large
          town located in western North Carolina near Lake Norman. Given the
          high level of quality that was present on the field and seductive
          allure of winning a tournament trophy, the intensity for the players
          and for the parents was high. During the championship game that my
          brother’s team had reached, the tensions that had been building
          throughout the event finally exploded in a ugly way. Before the game
          had even reached halftime, parents from both teams could be seen
          hurling vulgar obscenities at the referee, approaching each other with
          threats of violence, and creating a truly toxic atmosphere for a bunch
          of kids to play a game where the objective is to simply kick a ball.
          Certain parents were eventually tossed out of the game and escorted
          away from the premises, while other parents had to be threatened with
          the possibility of notifying the police if they could not control
          themselves. Rather than celebrate their child’s athletic achievements,
          some parents at this game chose to make the game all about themselves
          as they embarrassed not only themselves but also their own children.
          To provide some context for this issue, travel soccer in the United
          States and competitive youth sports in general are ridiculously
          expensive and therefore parents understandably want to see a polished
          end product which justifies the financial investment that they are
          making. However, it baffles me why it is so hard for some parents to
          understand that their child will never be the next Lionel Messi or
          Lebron James, and that’s perfectly okay. There are some things in life
          that matter more than the wins and losses of a sports game, such as
          values like respect or sportsmanship. Mistakes happen, but these
          values need to be taught to children like any other lesson, which
          includes setting a good example for the children to emulate. Some of
          my greatest memories from my childhood come from the moments playing
          sports when I could express myself freely and without stress or
          anxiety. Life can be brutal and usually shows no mercy, so let’s all
          enjoy the moments that give us an escape from the reality of life and
          soak in the fun that comes our way.
