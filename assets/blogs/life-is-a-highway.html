        <h5 class="blog-title">LIFE IS A HIGHWAY, AND I WANT TO DRIVE IT</h5>
        <p class="blog-text">
          When I was sixteen, my mom had saved up enough money to buy a brand
          new minivan straight out of the assembly line. For my sixteen-year-old
          self, this was the equivalent of winning the lottery, since this meant
          that I could now inherit my mother’s old car and finally live out
          every kid’s teenage dream. Even though the car was only a beat up 2002
          Izuzu Rodeo, an SUV that had already broken down multiple times and
          whose parent company had gone out of business, it might as well been a
          Lamborghini for all I cared. It was my own car! My mouth was already
          watering at the thought of rolling up to school with my windows down
          and radio blaring. The world was at my fingertips and it felt like I
          had nothing separating me from my dreams but the open highways that I
          could now drive to my heart’s content. <br /><br />
          My first dose of reality came
          during my junior year prom. As I was driving in my overpriced tuxedo
          to pick up my A road stretching through the countrysidehot date for
          the prom, I realized that a huge pillar of smoke had suddenly
          blossomed from the hood of my car. When I looked down at my dash, my
          heart literally froze when I saw the needle on the thermostat had
          torpedoed all the way down to H for ridiculously hot. My head gasket
          had exploded, and instead of picking up my date and taking her to prom
          like a princess, I had to instead ask if we could take her car to the
          dance. Although I can look back on this moment with a smile and laugh
          about my comedic misfortune, the feeling of embarrassment on that day
          stung and allowed me to realize a valuable lesson about myself and the
          attitude that I want to take towards my life. <br /><br />
          The cliche goes like
          this: It’s not about the destination, it’s about the journey. And
          while I believe that these words are true and can be applied to
          everyday life, I also believe that the concept of a destination can
          constantly change as a person changes. Whenever I hop into the
          driver’s seat to drive my car, the purpose behind me driving is to
          reach a predetermined destination that I want to reach. But once I
          reach my destination, the endpoint always changes to something new and
          the process repeats itself. I believe that life is similar in that
          there really is no destination, just a series of journeys that build
          on each other. Rather than get worked up over something like a broken
          car, it is important to put everything in perspective and focus on the
          greater picture for the direction that we all want our journey to
          take. Life is your highway, so drive it to whatever route or rhythm
          that you desire.
