        <h5 class="blog-title">ALWAYS READY, ALWAYS THERE</h5>
        <br />
        <p class="blog-text">
          During my freshman year of college at Chapel Hill, I was reluctantly
          doing laundry late one night when a prototypical ROTC army cadet
          walked in to toss his huge pile of dirty clothes into the laundry.
          Given how the guy had apparently had a long day and was out of clean
          clothes to wear, the cadet was still wearing his immaculate army
          uniform for which all aspiring army officers in college are required
          to wear. As if a magical unicorn or Jesus himself had just walked in
          the room, all the other students who were doing laundry immediately
          paused what they were doing to take stock of the different looking man
          who was trying to work the washing machine. As the cadet went about
          his business and left to go back to his room, I couldn’t help but
          smile as the realization hit me that I definitely was not in
          Fayetteville anymore. <br /><br />Fort Bragg is the largest military
          installation in the United States, holding approximately 53,700 troops
          and covering a staggering 163,000 acres of land. It is without
          question the center of the army for our nation and is home to some of
          the most formidable armed units on this side of the western
          hemisphere. The city of Fayetteville is literally located
          <img class="blog-image" src="../images/American-flag.jpg" /> right
          outside of Fort Bragg, and the pair shares a unique bond that is both
          strange and mutually beneficial. Given the immense population of Fort
          Bragg, Fayetteville provides the soldiers with an alternative to
          living on base and offers an escape from their all-consuming life of
          service. Additionally, it is incredibly rare for a military
          installation the size of Fort Bragg to be located so close to a city
          as big as Fayetteville. On the other hand, Fayetteville is completely
          dependent on the economic benefits that Fort Bragg brings and could
          not survive in its current condition without the presence of the
          military. Although the two are complete opposites from a cultural
          perspective, the fates of Fayetteville and our nations armed forces
          are forever intertwined. <br /><br />Growing up as an army brat in
          Fayetteville, seeing men and women in uniform on a daily basis was
          simply a part of everyday life for me. All of my neighbors had
          connections to the military, and when I was in elementary school I
          used to wear my father’s over-sized army uniform on military
          appreciation day. Regardless of what store or restaurant you went to,
          it seemed like there would always be a person in a desert camouflage
          uniform there. When I moved into Chapel Hill for college, it had never
          occurred to me that this connection to our nation’s military was not
          experienced by everyone. After seeing the reaction of the students in
          the laundry room, I realized that oftentimes the sacrifices of those
          who serve to protect our freedom can oftentimes go unnoticed or
          unheard. Although the expression may be overused, it genuinely is true
          that freedom certainly isn’t free. When you get a chance, take a
          moment to think about the brave men and women who live there lives for
          the purpose of always being ready and always being present when
          needed.
