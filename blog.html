            There are certain months that have a greater meaning than others because of some
            special event that happens during the month. December is treasured
            because it serves as the home to Christmas, July is famous for the
            Fourth of July, and the month of April <a href="assets/blogs/the-best-four-years-of-your-life.html">[…]</a>

          When I was sixteen, my mom had saved up enough money to buy a
          brand new minivan straight out of the assembly line. For my
          sixteen-year-old self, this was the equivalent of winning the lottery,
          since this meant that I could now inherit my mother’s <a href="assets/blogs/life-is-a-highway.html">[…]</a>

            <h5 class="blog-title">Adapting to a Different Culture</h5>
          </a>
          <p class="blog-date"><i>September 17, 2018</i></p>
          My mother lived a pretty straightforward life back in her home country
          of Panama. Originally born in the rural Panamanian countryside, my
          mother and her family migrated to the metropolis of Panama City when
          she was a young girl for the greater economic benefits that the city
          provides. From that point on, my mom would embark on the journey of
          trying to further her educational opportunities as a young women in
          the big city while also helping to provide for her family. However,
          everything in my mother’s life changed when she met an ambitious
          American soldier who convinced her to trade the life she lived in
          Panama for another in a foreign land completely different from her
          own. Fast forward over twenty years to the present, and my mother is
          the poster child for the ideal American citizen and fully immersed
          herself in this country’s different culture. But the transition for
          her was anything but easy, and this struggle of adaption is a problem
          experienced by someone new every minute. Trying to adapt to a
          different culture and a different way of life may seem like a simple
          issue from the outside looking in, but in reality words really cannot
          describe how difficult the transition can be for someone who has only
          known one way of life. Whether it be the food, the language, the
          physical environment, or even the societal values, these cultural
          differences can easily shock someone into despair as they try
          desperately try to make sense of the new universe that they now find
          themselves in. At my old high school back in Fayetteville, we had a
          foreign exchange program in place that provided the school with
          students originally from South Korea who had minimal experience with
          the American culture. Without questions, one of the greatest sources
          of pride from those affiliated with the school is the remarkable
          development of these exchange students, whose personas gradually
          change from lost and confused to confident and successful. This
          process is certainly not the same with everybody, but there are few
          feeling better than witnessing someone who has come from so far
          finally reach their goals. As of the time of writing, my mother is
          currently working as a English Second Language teacher throughout the
          Cumberland County school system. On a daily basis, my mom works with
          young children from different backgrounds to try to overcome some of
          the same cultural issues that she herself once battled with. Some
          children succeed more than others, but either way the results are
          often tangible improvements in at least the child’s willingness to
          explore the new way of life that they are surrounded in. We all have
          values and beliefs that make up who we are, and oftentimes these
          values are intertwined in the environment in which they were formed.
          Once that environment changes, it can be hard to hold on to the core
          of who we are while also trying to adjust ourselves to the values of a
          new environment. The next time you see someone who is going through a
          period of adjustment, keep in mind the personal struggle that they are
          going through and try to turn their attention to the bright
          possibilities of the future.

          Within the fibers of American culture, there lies certain customs and
          institutions that build up to form the world-renowned American DNA
          that is known around the world. Think about things like fireworks on
          the Fourth of July, or a greasy cheeseburger sizzling on the grill,

            During my freshman year of college at Chapel Hill, I was
            reluctantly doing laundry late one night when a prototypical ROTC army
            cadet walked in to toss his huge pile of dirty clothes into the
            laundry. Given how the guy had apparently had a long <a href="assets/blogs/always-ready-always-there.html">[…]</a>

          Let me be crystal clear here, I truly believe that Fayetteville, North
          Carolina, is a pretty unique and special city. While it may be true
          that Fayetteville doesn’t have the towering skyscrapers of New York
          City or the attractive southern charm of a place like Charleston,
          there are special qualities to Fayetteville that are hard to grasp
          until you experience them. And while it is also extremely valid that
          Fayetteville has a ridiculously high crime, drug, and poverty rate, I
          believe in the efforts that the city is making towards a better future
          and choose to embrace the city’s damaged pebbles ratter then shun
          them. As someone who has spent their entire life living in a single
          location, until recently I had never been fortunate enough to travel
          to different parts of North Carolina other than the Piedmont and
          Coastal regions. However, thanks to a good friend that I have grown
          close to during my time in college. everything for me changed this
          summer when I had the opportunity to visit him in the western town of
          Boone. I might as well have been visiting another planet. A small
          college town located in the Blue Ridge Mountains of western North
          Carolina, Boone is surrounded by absolutely breathing taking views and
          has a charming personality that could win over even the most stubborn
          of zealots. Given the beautiful location that the town resides in and
          the lack of urban expansion, nature is everything in Boone is a way of
          life that consumes every individual. Although the weather in Boone can
          vary from perfect and balmy in the summer to a special kind of cold
          that will make your insides freeze in the winter, the impact of nature
          on the daily life of those within the Watauga (the county for which
          Boone resides) community does not waver. The population of the town
          doubles when the local college of Appalachian State is in session, and
          for some, this connection to the university serves as the only
          possible gateway into a world and culture that truly has a brand of
          its own. For someone who has never seen a mountain before, the initial
          drive up to Boone was eye-opening to say the least. As my ears were
          popping at a sporadic rate due to the rapid increase in elevation, I
          remember being overwhelmed with the raw beauty of the scenes around me
          as I soaked in how special each mountaintop looked as they reached out
          into the golden sky. Being able to look down at all of creation below
          from an elevated platform of serenity seems like the type of
          situations to only happen in movies, but experiencing it personally
          was a moment that I will cherish forever. However, what struck me most
          was the attitudes of the local people. Everyone was incredibly kind
          during my visit and seemed to have significantly different priorities
          than what I was accustomed to. Rather than focus on the stress and
          uncertainties of life, the focus of the local people seemed to be on
          enjoying the special moments that we have been given today. With life
          on the other side of the state, beauty seems to exist not only with
          nature but also in the soul of the communities.

          If a religion is a set of
          beliefs and rules that a person devotes themselves to because they
          believe in a greater importance, then the raw passion that I witnessed
