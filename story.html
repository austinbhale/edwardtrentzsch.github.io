          >, Falcon can often seem to be a million miles away from the various
          domestic issues that continue to escalate within the state and
          country. However, after looking past the infinite fields of cotton
          that blanket the ground like snow, it becomes apparent that there is a
          different kind of issue that weighs heavily on the minds of those with
          close connections in the community.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h5 style="text-align: center;">A CHANGING WORLD</h5>
        <p>
          Falcon serves as the setting for
          <a
            href="http://www.falconchildrenshome.com/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Falcon Children’s Home</a
          >, a growing child care facility that strives to offer
          guidance,support, and safety to the children entrusted to be in their
          care, many of whom come from broken backgrounds interlaced with
          tragedy. Founded in 1909, the campus at the children’s home has grown
          immeasurably throughout the decades and is now officially licensed to
          serve 109 children. Yet despite the enormous impact that Falcon
          Children’s Home and other foster care facilities across the state of
          North Carolina have on society, their future remains uncertain. The
          demand for foster care in the state of North Carolina has exploded at
          a tremendous rate during the past decade, with a total increase of
          nearly 1,784 children from 2012-2016
          <a
            href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/cb/resource/trends-in-foster-care-and-adoption"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >(ACF)</a
          >. Given the dramatic increase in demand, children homes and other
          foster care facilities throughout the state have struggled to cope
          with the influx of children given their already limited
          resources.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, the future implementation of the Family First Prevention
          Services Act has the potential to completely alter the outlook for
          foster care across the country. According to the
          <a
            href="https://campaignforchildren.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/06/FFCC-Short-Summary-FFPSA.pdf"

            rel="noopener"
            >Campaign for Children</a
          >
          website, the new piece of legislature will aim to “prevent children
          from entering foster care by allowing federal reimbursement for mental
          health services, substance use treatment, and in-home parenting skill
          training”, while also seeking to “improve the well-being of children
          already in foster by incentivizing states to reduce placement of
          children in congregate care” (FFCC). On the surface, this bill appears
          to remedy the issue of foster homes being overwhelmed by funneling
          resources towards prevention with an emphasis on negating the unstable
          scenario at home that would necessitate the need for foster care. As a
          result, a significant amount of federal funding to children homes
          would be slashed. While the premise of taking children out of foster
          care so that they can remain with their families is noble, it fails to
          take into account the ugly realities that often face these children by
          remaining at their original homes. As discussed by Falcon Children’s
          Home CEO/Superintendent Joseph Leggett, often the most destructive
          part of the entire foster process can be:&nbsp; &nbsp;
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “once we get to working with that child, many times we see them
            improve or we see their whole outlook on life and change. And then
            we know we have to let them go back to the environment they came
            from”.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <h5 style="text-align: center;">A HOME ON A MISSION</h5>
        <p>
          Even with the future of foster care shrouded in a dark uncertainty,
          the overall vision at Falcon Children’s Home to provide a beacon of
          light to those in desperate need of help has never wavered. Since
          2011, Falcon has expanded their ministries to include a Teen Mothers
          and Babies Program, as well as a private Christian school titled
          Falcon Christian Academy. Last year, Falcon Christian Academy
          graduated 13 students, with 10 of these graduates going off to
          university to pursue a higher education. These new programs to reach
          people in need were created in addition to the already established
          Royal Home Ministries, a program designed to offer assistance to teen
          pregnant mothers in navigating the difficult decisions of pregnancy.
          While the future remains uncertain, the administration at Falcon
          Children’s Home remains committed to giving hope for a better future.
          When asked about what makes Falcon different from any other children’s
          home, Mr. Leggett replied without a moment of hesitation “we put the
          children first in everything we do. Not just in policies and
          procedures, but also in the different things we do to make sure we can
          meet the kid’s needs”.&nbsp;
